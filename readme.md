# The Pocket Professor by DrPakfro

### A small, AI-powered tutor app designed to be your personal college level instructor

#### This repo is still under development, and made public to share with co-horts and friends. A full readme is on the way i promise


As of June 16th 2025:

- cleaned up app.py to remove the now un-used question/answer loop code blocks from the very first version of this app
- I moved the unused blocks over to snippets.py as an in-project repository of sorts to reference the earlier version of this project
- With these commits, the latest main branch will then become a template for the new MVP i want to work toward, with one main feature: take user prompts of subject, difficulty level, time commitments (in hours/week), and learning goal to create a dedicated learning guide for the user, and then exit. One primary function, one main feature, and then build from there.
Godspeed, me!


TODO: create a polished "version 0.01" of the app that had the original question/answer loop, using the knowledge base dictionary, jaccard similarity algo to check for typos, and THEN calls the LLM if the user wanted to ask a question outside of the knowledge base dictionary.
