<!--# The Pocket Professor by DrPakfro

## A small, AI-powered tutor app designed to be your personal college level instructor

### Pocket Professor is both a way to learn emerging tech and also combine my passions for education and technology. I am an academic at heart and I wanted to make something for my fellow autodidacts.

### Since I was about 13, anything I was interested in I explored deeply and tried to emulate by learning how to do it. I have taught myself how to play drums, taught myself how to cook, and taught myself how to code before attending the now defunct Coding Dojo bootcamp. Just to name a few things I was curious about and wanted to explore further.

### The internet is vast and varied, and while there are a plethora of learning platforms, tools, videos and docs at ones disposal, creating a learning guide/syllabus catered to ones own learning style is difficult. We have to create a hodge-podge, castaway type raft of assembled tools to learn our own way and I love the idea of a college-style syllabus that can be made to appeal to that need. So I figured why not make it myself?


#### This repo is still under development, and made public to share with co-horts and friends. A full readme is on the way i promise!!!

As of June 16th 2025:

- cleaned up app.py to remove the now un-used question/answer loop code blocks from the very first version of this app
- I moved the unused blocks over to snippets.py as an in-project repository of sorts to reference the earlier version of this project.
- With these commits, the latest main branch will then become a template for the new MVP i want to work toward, with one main feature: take user prompts of subject, difficulty level, time commitments (in hours/week), and learning goal to create a dedicated learning guide for the user, and then exit. One primary function, one main feature, and then build from there.
Godspeed, me!


TODO: create a polished "version 0.01" of the app that had the original question/answer loop, using the knowledge base dictionary, jaccard similarity algo to check for typos, and THEN calls the LLM if the user wanted to ask a question outside of the knowledge base dictionary. <!-->

### ‚ú® Core Features (MVP Goal)

* **Personalized Syllabus Generation:** Takes a user's subject, desired difficulty, learning goal, and time commitment.
* **Clear Learning Goals:** Creates a dedicated learning guide to help you achieve your objectives with a detailed and structured breakdown.
* **Focused Learning:** One primary function, executed well. The app generates your guide and then exits, allowing you to focus on learning.
