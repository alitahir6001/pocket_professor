# Phase 3 Adaptation Engine Build Slice (Initial)

## Scope delivered in this slice
This slice starts Phase 3 with a deterministic adaptation evaluator module and runnable rule tests. Evaluations now require caller-supplied `evaluated_at` timestamps to avoid runtime time-source nondeterminism.

### Implemented artifacts
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/policyEngine.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/adaptationEvaluationRecord.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/adaptationEvaluationService.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/adaptationEvaluationFileAdapter.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/adaptationEvaluationEntrypoints.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/adaptationFrameworkBindings.ts`
- `backend/tests/adaptation/policyEngine.test.ts`
- `backend/package.json` (test script for this slice)

## Deterministic rule coverage in code
Implemented required rule examples:
1. If 2 missed sessions in 7 days → reduce workload 25%
2. If 3 late-night sessions logged → shift suggested schedule
3. If topic resistance signal triggered → call Career Coach Agent
4. If pivot interest triggered → recalculate curriculum graph
5. If 5 consecutive completed sessions → increase difficulty slightly

## Output contract (engine)
Input requires:
- `user_id`
- `evaluated_at` (valid ISO timestamp string)
- windowed counter object

The evaluator returns:
- `engine_version` (explicit evaluator version tag)
- `evaluated_at`
- `applied_rules`
- `mutations` with:
  - `rule_id`
  - `trigger_window`
  - `events_used`
  - `mutation_applied`

## Structural mutation cap behavior
- Structural mutation type(s) are explicitly classified.
- Weekly structural cap is enforced in evaluator output: `max 1`.
- Structural mutations beyond cap are returned in `deferred_mutations` with `STRUCTURAL_CAP_REACHED`.
- Non-structural mutations continue to apply in the same run.

## Persistence adapter + transactional wiring
- `buildAdaptationEvaluationRecord` prepares a DB-ready payload aligned to `adaptation_evaluations` architecture fields.
- `persistAdaptationEvaluationOrThrow` now wires transaction lifecycle (`begin -> insert -> commit`) via injected repository/transaction interfaces.
- Structural mutations are fail-closed: persistence write failures raise `AUDIT_PERSISTENCE_FAILED` after best-effort rollback so structural changes cannot proceed without an audit row.
- Non-structural persistence failures rethrow original storage errors after rollback attempt.

## Slice 5 orchestration module
- `runAdaptationEvaluationCycle` composes evaluator -> record builder -> transactional persistence in one deterministic service-level call.
- Service preserves fail-closed semantics by relying on persistence layer `AUDIT_PERSISTENCE_FAILED` behavior for structural mutation write failures.

## Slice A concrete persistence adapter
- Added a concrete file-backed persistence adapter (`adaptationEvaluationFileAdapter.ts`) that satisfies transaction/repository interfaces and writes auditable rows to JSON storage for local development/testing.
- Adapter is intentionally local-first (JSON file) to keep infrastructure friction low while preserving transaction semantics and fail-closed structural behavior.

## Slice B API/worker entrypoints
- Added `handleAdaptationEvaluationApiRequest` and `handleAdaptationEvaluationWorkerJob` to wire runtime entrypoints into the deterministic service pipeline.
- Entrypoints support concrete file adapter defaults plus injectable dependencies for deterministic tests and fail-closed behavior checks.

## Security hardening mini-slice
- Strengthened prohibited-content guard patterns to catch broader therapeutic/clinical framing variants.
- Added tamper-evident audit chain fields (`previous_record_hash`, `record_hash`) in file-backed audit persistence and verification helper `verifyStoredEvaluationChain`.

## Slice C framework-level bindings
- Added framework-agnostic HTTP/worker binding module (`adaptationFrameworkBindings.ts`) that maps runtime transport semantics to deterministic entrypoint calls.
- HTTP binding maps outcomes to explicit statuses (`200`, `400`, `503`) and machine-readable error codes.
- Worker binding maps outcomes to deterministic result envelopes (`completed`/`failed`) for queue integration.

## Slice D Fastify runtime wrapper + smoke script
- Added concrete Fastify runtime bootstrap script (`backend/scripts/run_adaptation_fastify.mjs`) with health route (`GET /adaptation/health`) and adaptation route (`POST /adaptation/evaluate`) using `handleAdaptationHttpRoute`.
- Added smoke script (`backend/scripts/smoke_adaptation_runtime.sh`) that validates health, success path (`200`), malformed payload failure (`400`, `BAD_REQUEST`), tab Content-Type probe failure (`400`, `BAD_REQUEST`), and oversized payload deterministic 4xx behavior.
- Fastify dependency updated to patched line (`>=5.7.3`) and runtime includes explicit `Content-Type` tab-character rejection hook for defense-in-depth.


## Slice E migration + worker runtime follow-through
- Added SQL migration artifacts for `adaptation_evaluations` (`up` + `down`) under `backend/db/migrations` with transactional apply/rollback behavior.
- Added migration runbook (`backend/docs/adaptation_evaluations_migration_runbook.md`) documenting apply checks, rollback checks, and runtime Postgres env wiring.
- Added a queue-style worker runtime script (`backend/scripts/run_adaptation_worker.mjs`) and smoke script (`backend/scripts/smoke_adaptation_worker.sh`) to exercise deterministic worker `completed`/`failed` envelopes outside HTTP transport, including idempotency + retry directives.
- Added observability diagnostics (`diagnostic_code`) classification for adaptation HTTP/worker failures to speed triage and troubleshooting.


## Slice F broker + telemetry progression
- Added broker-style worker batch processor (`adaptationBrokerWorker.ts`) with deterministic retry/dead-letter routing.
- Added telemetry aggregator (`adaptationTelemetryAggregator.ts`) for broker counters (`total`, `completed`, `retried`, `dead_lettered`).
- Added runnable broker worker runtime wrapper (`backend/scripts/run_adaptation_broker_worker.mjs`) and smoke script (`backend/scripts/smoke_adaptation_broker_worker.sh`).

## Current conflicts
- No conflict with behavioral principles or phase architecture detected.
- Determinism improvement applied: evaluator no longer uses `new Date()` internally and fails closed on invalid inputs.
- Progress: environment-selectable persistence wiring now supports file-backed local runs and injected Postgres pool usage for runtime evaluation requests.
- Progress: migration artifacts + operational runbook now exist for `adaptation_evaluations`, and a deterministic worker runtime path is available for queue-style execution.
- Remaining gap: production broker adapter integration (SQS/Rabbit/Redis Streams) and centralized telemetry sink/export are still pending before micro-pilot.
- TypeScript migration completed for Phase 3 evaluator, persistence modules, orchestration service, and slice tests.

## Summary
- Phase 3 now has deterministic rule evaluation, typed evaluation-record construction, transaction-aware persistence wiring, and runtime-facing API/worker bindings.
- Structural adaptations remain fail-closed when audit persistence fails, preserving the system invariant that structural changes must have auditable records.
- A local file-backed adapter remains the default local path, and the runtime can now select the Postgres-oriented adapter through environment-based wiring for production-style persistence.

## Next steps
1. Integrate broker worker path with a production transport adapter (SQS/Rabbit/Redis Streams) instead of file queues.
2. Add centralized telemetry export/aggregation (e.g., OpenTelemetry/Prometheus sink) for adaptation and broker counters.
3. Run a pre-pilot hardening pass (config validation, failure runbooks, and dependency install checks).
4. Run a micro-pilot gate with explicit success criteria (stability, audit completeness, and intervention quality sampling).
