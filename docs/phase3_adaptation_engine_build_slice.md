# Phase 3 Adaptation Engine Build Slice (Initial)

## Scope delivered in this slice
This slice starts Phase 3 with a deterministic adaptation evaluator module and runnable rule tests. Evaluations now require caller-supplied `evaluated_at` timestamps to avoid runtime time-source nondeterminism.

### Implemented artifacts
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/policyEngine.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/adaptation/phase3/adaptationEvaluationRecord.ts`
- `backend/tests/adaptation/policyEngine.test.ts`
- `backend/package.json` (test script for this slice)

## Deterministic rule coverage in code
Implemented required rule examples:
1. If 2 missed sessions in 7 days → reduce workload 25%
2. If 3 late-night sessions logged → shift suggested schedule
3. If topic resistance signal triggered → call Career Coach Agent
4. If pivot interest triggered → recalculate curriculum graph
5. If 5 consecutive completed sessions → increase difficulty slightly

## Output contract (engine)
Input requires:
- `user_id`
- `evaluated_at` (valid ISO timestamp string)
- windowed counter object

The evaluator returns:
- `engine_version` (explicit evaluator version tag)
- `evaluated_at`
- `applied_rules`
- `mutations` with:
  - `rule_id`
  - `trigger_window`
  - `events_used`
  - `mutation_applied`

## Structural mutation cap behavior
- Structural mutation type(s) are explicitly classified.
- Weekly structural cap is enforced in evaluator output: `max 1`.
- Structural mutations beyond cap are returned in `deferred_mutations` with `STRUCTURAL_CAP_REACHED`.
- Non-structural mutations continue to apply in the same run.

## Persistence adapter scaffold
- `buildAdaptationEvaluationRecord` prepares a DB-ready payload aligned to `adaptation_evaluations` architecture fields.
- This slice intentionally stops at adapter payload creation and does not execute DB writes.

## Current conflicts
- No conflict with behavioral principles or phase architecture detected.
- Determinism improvement applied: evaluator no longer uses `new Date()` internally and fails closed on invalid inputs.
- Known gap: adapter scaffolding exists, but actual DB transaction/persistence wiring is not implemented yet.
- Known gap: API/queue orchestration integration is not wired yet (engine remains module + tests).
- TypeScript migration completed for Phase 3 evaluator, adapter scaffold, and slice tests to align with project stack consistency.
