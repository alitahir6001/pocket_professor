## Layman translation
### Here's what it means in plain terms
- This document explains one part of how Pocket Professor gives reliable, safe career guidance instead of random AI advice.

### Why it's built
- It exists so product, engineering, and operations can make the same decisions from a shared, understandable reference.

### How it helps a service worker switch careers
- It makes the system more predictable and easier to trust, so learners get practical next steps without confusing plan changes.


## Purpose
Maps generic adaptation entrypoints to HTTP-like and worker-like runtime contracts with deterministic status/error shapes.

## Architecture mapping
- Thin framework binding layer separating transport concerns from business orchestration.
- Normalizes operational outputs for routing, retries, and observability.

## Block-by-block walkthrough
1. **Dependency and request/response types**
   - Framework dependency bundle mirrors entrypoint dependencies.
2. **HTTP route binding**
   - Calls API entrypoint.
   - Maps success to `200` payload.
   - Maps audit persistence fail-closed to `503` payload.
   - Maps all thrown validation/config errors to `400 BAD_REQUEST` with diagnostic code.
3. **Worker message binding**
   - Calls worker entrypoint.
   - Returns `completed` payload on success.
   - Returns `failed` payload with `error_code` + `diagnostic_code` on any exception.

## Failure modes
- Non-entrypoint runtime exceptions are captured and normalized instead of leaking stack-specific behavior.

## Pilot risk level
**Medium-High**: wrong mapping can create retry storms or poor client UX.

## Suggested refactor
- Introduce centralized error-code map shared across HTTP and worker handlers.
