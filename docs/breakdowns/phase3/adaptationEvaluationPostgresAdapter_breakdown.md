## Layman translation
### Here's what it means in plain terms
- This document explains one part of how Pocket Professor gives reliable, safe career guidance instead of random AI advice.

### Why it's built
- It exists so product, engineering, and operations can make the same decisions from a shared, understandable reference.

### How it helps a service worker switch careers
- It makes the system more predictable and easier to trust, so learners get practical next steps without confusing plan changes.


## Purpose
Implements Postgres-backed transaction and repository adapters for adaptation evaluation persistence.

## Architecture mapping
- Production-grade persistence path behind shared persistence contract.
- DB transaction lifecycle owned here, business fail-closed logic remains in contract helper.

## Block-by-block walkthrough
1. **Pool/client interfaces**
   - Minimal `PostgresClientLike`/`PostgresPoolLike` interfaces keep adapter testable.
2. **Transaction implementation**
   - `commit` => `COMMIT` + `release`.
   - `rollback` => `ROLLBACK` + `release`.
   - Finalization guard prevents double-finalize.
3. **Transaction factory**
   - `begin` opens pooled client and executes `BEGIN`.
4. **Repository insert path**
   - Validates tx type.
   - Generates deterministic id prefix (`eval_...`).
   - Executes parameterized `INSERT ... RETURNING evaluation_id`.
   - Falls back to generated id if db row is unexpectedly missing.
5. **Adapter constructor**
   - `createPostgresPersistenceAdapter` returns txFactory/repository pair.

## Failure modes
- Wrong tx type -> explicit error.
- SQL/query failures -> propagated for higher-level handling.

## Pilot risk level
**High**: directly governs durable audit writes in production mode.

## Suggested refactor
- Wrap db errors into typed persistence errors for richer diagnostics.
